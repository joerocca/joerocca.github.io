**The Iron Yard**

*Mobile Engineering* &middot; February 2015 - May 2015

The Iron Yard is a 12-week immersive code school. I learned how to use Xcode, Git, Objective-C, and a good portion of Swift. During the first 9 weeks, my classmates and I attended lectures from 9am-12pm, then completed a project by the following morning. The final 3 weeks we worked on a project of our choosing. I created Bagel Runner, an endless runner game which I presented at The Iron Yard's Demo Day.
