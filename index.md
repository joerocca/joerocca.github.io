I am a Software Developer and Cybersecurity Apprentice in Tampa Bay working on and continually learning more about building applications and securing them in the process. I have been writing software since 2014, when I started teaching myself. I previously worked as an Application Developer at Symphonic Distribution before I left to expand my skills by pursuing an intensive cybersecurity education. I am now seeking opportunities to contribute to a company's growth while expanding my development, security, and operations skills beyond my current knowledge.
