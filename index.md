I am a Software Developer in Tampa Bay working on and continually learning more about building applications. I've been writing software since 2015, when I was in school at The Iron Yard. I previously worked as a Application Developer at Symphonic Distribution before I left to expand my skills by pursuing a intensive cybersecurity education through SecureSet Academy.
